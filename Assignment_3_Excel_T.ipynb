    "Q1. What do you mean by “Relative Cell Referencing” in MS Excel and “Absolute cell referencing”?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer -  A cell reference or relative cell reference describes how far away a cell or group of cells is from another cell in the same spreadsheet. For example, to add cells A2 and B2 together you could use the formula \"=SUM(A2+B2)\" in cell C2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An absolute cell reference is a cell reference in a spreadsheet application that remains constant even if the shape or size of the spreadsheet is changed, or the reference is copied or moved to another cell or sheet. Absolute cell references are important when referring to constant values in a spreadsheet.\n",

    "    \n",
    "1. Select File > Info.\n",

    "2. Select the Protect Workbook box and choose Encrypt with Password.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. Explain the pivot tables and their implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - A Pivot Table is used to summarise, sort, reorganise, group, count, total or average data stored in a table. It allows us to transform columns into rows and rows into columns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Their implementation -:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A PivotTable is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data. You can use a PivotTable to analyze numerical data in detail, and answer unanticipated questions about your data.\n",
    "    Moving rows to columns or columns to rows (or \"pivoting\") to see different summaries of the source data.\n",
    "    Presenting concise, attractive, and annotated online or printed reports.\n",

    "Q4. Explain lookup in excel with suitable examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - At the most basic level, the LOOKUP function in Excel searches a value in one column or row and returns a matching value from the same position in another column or row.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two forms of LOOKUP in Excel: Vector and Array. \n",
    "    \n",
    "     a vector refers to a one-column or one-row range. Consequently, you use the vector form of LOOKUP to search one row or one column of data for a specified value, and pull a value from the same position in another row or column.\n",
    "     The syntax of the vector Lookup is as follows:\n",
    "     LOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_vector, [result_vector])\n",
    "     \n",
    "     The array form of the LOOKUP function searches the specified value in the first column or row of the array and retrieves a value from the same position in the last column or row of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The array Lookup has 2 arguments, both of which are required:\n",
    "    LOOKUP(lookup_value, array)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example = \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, if your lookup value is \"5\", the formula will search it first. If \"5\" is not found, it will search \"4\". If \"4\" is not found, it will search \"3\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If lookup_value is smaller than the smallest value in lookup_vector, Excel LOOKUP returns the #N/A error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is Data validation, and how to implement it in Excel?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - Excel data validation is a feature that allows you to control the type of data entered into your worksheet. For example, Excel data validation allows you to limit data entries to a selection from a dropdown list and to restrict certain data entries, such as dates or numbers outside of a predetermined range.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    steps -:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Select the cell(s) you want to create a rule for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select Data >Data Validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. On the Settings tab, under Allow, select an option:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Whole Number - to restrict the cell to accept only whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Decimal - to restrict the cell to accept only decimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - List - to pick data from the drop-down list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Date - to restrict the cell to accept only date.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Time - to restrict the cell to accept only time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Text Length - to restrict the length of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Custom – for custom formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Under Data, select a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set the other required values based on what you chose for Allow and Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Select the Input Message tab and customize a message users will see when entering data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Select the Show input message when cell is selected checkbox to display the message when the user selects or hovers over the selected cell(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Select the Error Alert tab to customize the error message and to choose a Style.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Select OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, if the user tries to enter a value that is not valid, an Error Alert appears with your customized message."
